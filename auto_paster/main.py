main.py

Automated workflow for taking a screenshot, allowing the user to crop a region,
performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the cropped image, and copying the recognized text to the clipboard.

Modules Used:
- PIL.ImageGrab: For capturing screenshots.
- Screenshot.fontend.FontendApp: Tkinter frontend for cropping images.
- Screenshot.recangledrawer.RectangleDrawerBackend: Backend for rectangle drawing/cropping.
- pytesseract: For OCR (requires Tesseract-OCR installed).
- pyperclip: For copying text to clipboard.

Workflow:
1. Take a screenshot.
2. Let the user crop a region interactively.
3. Run OCR on the cropped image.
4. Copy the recognized text to the clipboard.

Usage:
    python main.py
